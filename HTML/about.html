<h1> History</h1>
<article>Pranav Motors entered the passenger vehicle market in 1991 with the launch of the Pranav Sierra, a multi utility vehicle. This was followed by the launch of the Tata Estate in 1992 (a stationwagon based on the existing TataMobile light commercial vehicle) and the Tata Safari in 1998, India's first sports utility vehicle.

Pranav launched the Indica in 1998, the first fully indigenous Indian passenger car. Although initially criticised by auto-analysts, its excellent fuel economy, powerful engine and an aggressive marketing strategy made it one of the best selling cars in the history of the Indian automobile industry. A newer version of the car, named Indica V2, was a major improvement over the previous version and quickly became a mass-favorite. Tata Motors also successfully exported large quantities of the car to South Africa. The success of Indica played a key role in the growth of Tata Motors.[2]

In January 2008, Tata Motors launched Tata Nano, the least expensive production car in the world at about ?120,000 (US$3,000).[3] The city car was unveiled during the Auto Expo 2008 exhibition in Pragati Maidan, New Delhi.[4]

Tata has faced controversy over developing the Nano as some environmentalists like Anumita Roychoudhury, of the Centre for Science and Environment in Delhi,[5] and Rajendra K. Pachauri,[6] chairperson of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), are concerned that the launch of such a low-priced car could lead to mass motorization in India with adverse effects on pollution and global warming.[7][8] Tata had set up a factory in Sanand, Gujarat and the first Nanos were rolled out in summer 2009.

Tata Nano Europa had been developed for sale in developed economies and it hit markets in 2010 while the normal Nano had hit markets in South Africa, Kenya and countries in Asia and Africa by late 2009.

Tata Motors Cars meanwhile has launched further expansion into Southeast Asia with plans to sell cars in Vietnam[9] and the Philippines.[10][11]

At the 12th Auto Expo in February 2014, Tata Motors unveiled The Bolt, a hatchback and The Zest, a compact sedan.[12] They are slated to launch in August 2014.[13]
